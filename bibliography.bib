In this paper, precise bounds are derived for several anomalies of this type.},  keywords={},  doi={10.1002/j.1538-7305.1966.tb01709.x},  ISSN={0005-8580},  month={Nov},}

 abstract = {The "branch-and-bound" algorithm for the exact solution of a three-machine scheduling problem proposed by Lomnicki has been generalized to the case of an arbitrary number of machines (under the assumption of an identical order on all the machines) and it has been adapted for an electronic computer. The flow chart of this algorithm used in the programming of calculations has been given and the efficiency of the method has been illustrated by some experimental evaluations of optimum job sequencing.},
